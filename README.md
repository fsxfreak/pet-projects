pet-projects
============

pet-projects contains several projects that are too small to deserve their own repo. Usually, my pet-projects are small utilities that I use to organize my life or automate something.

Most of these utilities run in the command line. Some are Windows only, but others are written to be multiplatform. I will try to point out in the READMEs of each utility what dependencies are needed. Since most of the time directories are hardcoded, if you wish to use this code in your own computer and/or for a different OS than Windows, you may have to go through the source code to change some directories to work for you.

## Exploring
The source code for each pet-project is located in the base directory of their respective folders. All header files (external and internal dependencies) are located in ```include/```.
* ```font-organizer``` - Pulls all font files from a given font directory, and copies all custom (user) fonts to a separate directory.
* ```random-renamer``` - Renames all files (not directories) in a given directory to a random name. Preserves file extensions.
